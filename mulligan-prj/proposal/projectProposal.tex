\section{Dog Breed Identification}
When figuring out what to do for my project, I was exploring past kaggle 
competitions to get some ideas.  I came across a competition about identifying 
different breeds of dogs from images and it sparked my interest.  For this project 
I plan on building a classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network and dog 
breeds.  The past competition on kaggle gives me access to labeled data as well 
as training and testing data.  To build this classifier, I would plan on doing it 
in Tensorflow.  Here is a link to the past kaggle competition which has the data I 
could use to build this classifier: \href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification}
{Dog Breed Identification}.
